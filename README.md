Initial Commit: To understand SCM and Version Control

Final commit: To check if a number is an armstrong number or not. 
An armstrong number is the sum of a number's digits raised to the power total of digits.

Example: 3 = 3^1 = 3
        153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153
        
3 and 153 are Armstrong numbers.
